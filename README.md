## Welcome to Movie Quiz.

The Movie Quiz is an app which generates randomized movie trivia quizes using data from a movie database API.

This project was completed in a group with Alina Kovaleva, Tom Collins, and Vasileios Bomponis.

This is an App made as part of my final Group Project as a Student in Coddaiseur Coding BootCamp. This project made in 4 days from scratch using no templates or previous code.

This is a full stack app which includes a [back-end](https://github.com/poojadalai/quizApp-backend), however it is very basic consisting only of routes to view the scoreboard and post high scores.

<!-- ## My contribution
I have implemented and designed the main question page with the animation and also setting up the backend. -->

## The idea behind the Movie Quiz.

I know that from experience and since now i have the tools i took the liberty to start a small revolution by making a new easy to use, friendly and FREE App for anyone who want to have some fun.
